    Inventory Management: The system will keep track of all the equipment available for rent. Each equipment item will have details such as its name, type, quantity available, and pricing information.

    Availability Calendar: There will be a calendar feature that shows the availability of each equipment item. This calendar will help users visualize when specific equipment is available for rental and when it's already booked.

    Booking System: Users will be able to make bookings for equipment through the system. They can check the availability of equipment for specific dates and reserve items accordingly. Once a booking is made, the system will update the availability calendar accordingly.

    User Management: To ensure security and control access, the system will have user authentication and authorization features. Only authorized users will be able to access certain functionalities, such as making bookings or managing equipment inventory.

    Technologies Used: Your project will utilize various technologies to implement these features. This might include Java for backend development, Spring Boot for rapid development, MySQL for database management, Hibernate for object-relational mapping, and frontend technologies like Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for user interface design.

    Setup and Contribution: You'll provide clear instructions on how to set up the project locally for development or testing purposes. Additionally, you may outline guidelines for contributing to the project, allowing other developers to collaborate and improve the system.
